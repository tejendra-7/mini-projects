<h1>Mini_projects</h1>

This repository contains a collection of mini projects that I have been working on. Each project is a small, self-contained piece of code that focuses on a specific concept or problem. These mini projects serve as a way for me to explore different programming languages, frameworks, and algorithms, while also honing my coding skills. Feel free to explore the projects and use them as a learning resource or inspiration for your own projects. Happy coding!
